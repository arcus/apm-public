# Sprint Goals

When facilitating a Scrum Master training, the Sprint Goal is a topic that often causes a good discussion. Participants question the background, purpose and advantages of using a Sprint Goal. In this blog post I'll describe the concept in more detail, explain why using a Sprint Goal is important and how to choose an efficient goal.

# What is a Sprint Goal?
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. Sprint goals are the result of a negotiation between the Product Owner and the Development Team. Sprint Goals should be specific and measurable. While the selected work for the Sprint Backlog represents a forecast, the Development Team gives their commitment to achieving the Sprint Goal.

# Could You Give Some Examples?
Although I've stated that Sprint Goals should be specific and measurable I don't mean SMART. Just prevent the goals become to vague. But some examples might be:

`Get feature X ready for release` (hereby the Sprint Goal is delivering a feature)

`Check if the architecture enables the desired performance` (hereby the Sprint Goal is addressing a risk)

`Test if users are willing to register before using the product features` (hereby the Sprint Goal is testing an assumption)

# Why Use a Sprint Goal?
##An effective Sprint Goal...

- Serves to test assumptions, address risks or deliver features

- Ensures a focused Daily Scrum because the Development Team can use it to inspect their progress

- Provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment

- Offers flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint

- Helps setting priorities when "the going gets tough"

- Fosters teamwork and teambuilding by jointly working towards a shared Sprint Goal

- Supports the Product Owner in creating the product roadmap

- Stimulates Product Backlog cohesion when planning a release

- Can be used as an instrument for stakeholder management

- Supports a focused Sprint Planning by crafting a shared Sprint Goal

- Enables efficient decision-making

# How to Choose a Sprint Goal?

To determine what the Sprint Goal should be, Roman Pichler offers three questions to consider:

1. Why do we carry out the Sprint? Why is it worthwhile to run a sprint? What should be achieved?

1. How do we reach its goal? Which artefact, validation technique, and test group are used?

1. How do we know the goal has been met? For instance at least three of the five users carry out the usability test successfully in less than a minute

## Addendum: Estimating Effort/Story Points:

```
The best approach to start with relative estimation is to try some examples on real-life objects. Try to compare a phone to a laptop and LCD. Use the following scenario:

1. Put all the stories (objects) in front of developers.
2. Let them choose one story (object) that will get the number Effort=1. Typically it is a small story like „I as a user want to save a file to disk“.
3. Then compare all remaining stories relatively to a referenced story and other, already estimated stories.
4. For example, Story 2 – "I as a user want to calculate average values per year for every customer“ is a more complex story than Story 1 mentioned above. As a developer, I think that this story is 3 times harder than Story 1. Therefore  I will set Effort = 3 story points.

You will do this for every story in your product backlog. This estimation is done by developers and testers. The team sits together in a meeting room with the product owner and talking about stories, what he wants and needs. The product owner will say us as much as he can. We will ask him from a technology point of view. Some stories are changed during the discussion, some new stories can appear as well.

The product is typically estimated in 1-3 full days during the planning meeting.  All your developers and testers known what the product owner wants. The product owner meets with the development team. He sees developers hence closer relations can be built.

The size of stories is estimated in the Fibonacci scale. Scale is 0,0.5, 1,2,3, 5, 8, 13, 20,40,100.

If the story is bigger than the agreed limit (8, 13, or more) then it should be split into smaller stories. It is too complex to be developed.
