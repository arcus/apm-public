# Daily Scrum

_The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity._

##What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?


##Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
