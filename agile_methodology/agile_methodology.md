# Agile Methodology Course

Welcome to the Arcus Project Management training course for Agile Methodology! This course was designed as an entry-level guide for managing and executing projects using the Agile implementation approach. This article assumes that you are familiar with high-level best-practices of project management and the project life cycle , and focuses more on how to properly employ Agile execution. For more information specifically on Agile Jira Management, visit APM's [Agile Jira Management](https://wiki.chop.edu/display/ARCUS/Agile+Methodology+Overview) course.

## Terms & Acronyms

The following table provides a comprenhensive list of terms which may be useful for reference throughout this course:

<br/>

| Term | Description |
|:-|-|
|**Agile Methodology**|A project management & execution approach which relies on continuous and frequent collaboration with stakeholders through rapid and cyclical iterations. This methodology operates under the premise that a project can continuously be refined throughout its life cycle through consistent execution and communication in cycles referred to as Sprints.|
|**APM**|Arcus Project Management â€“ the core team that provides both internal and external project management support and organization for the Arcus program. In the context of Arcus, internal projects relate to efforts owned by other core teams or Arcus leadership. External projects relate to customer-facing projects such as scientific projects.|
|**Execution Methodology**| The process used to execute project tasks (i.e: Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid).|
|**Jira**|The web-based software platform Arcus uses to track and organize execution of projects & inititatives down to the task/sub-task level.|
|**Sprint**|A segment of time within which an execution team completes a set of tasks that will progress an overall effort or project. Traditionally, sprints are 2 weeks in length (~ 10 business days, where the first day is focused on planning, the last day is focused on release and retrospective, and the median 8 days are focused on task execution).|
|**Sprint Goal(s)**|A description of the accomplishments with which the development team aims to achieve by releasing the sprint once completed.|
|**Sprint Backlog**|A list of outstanding tasks queued for the current sprint which have not yet been started. All tasks in the sprint backlog must have been scoped, defined, estimated.|
|**Waterfall Methodology**|A project management & execution approach which relies on clearly defined boundaries and dependencies to progress (Ex: "Design must be completed before Development can begin.", or, "Testing cannot begin until Development is complete."). Typically requires some degree of approval to progress beteween boundaries (i.e: stakeholder or client approval).|

## Agile Methodology Overivew

In short, **Agile Methodology** is a rapid, cyclical, and iterative process for executing project tasks, where each cycle is reffered to as a **sprint**. What makes Agile even more unique from other methodologies are the benefits it reaps from its dependency on frequent consultation with stakeholders and users. Though a high-level plan and strategy should still exist for the project, purely Agile projects typically lack a detailed project plan because it would be counter-intutive to the approach's values. The scope of the immediately upcoming sprints will determine the short-term direction of the app design, which will be heavily informed by user stories and requests. 

A sprint is a segment of time within which the development team commits to a set of tasks required to progress or complete a project. The complete set of tasks make up the sprint scope, where each task will be assigned to a developer for execution. Though implementations vary, a traditional sprint will be 2 business weeks (10 business days), where the first day of the sprint is devoted to sprint planning and kickoff ceremonies, and the final day of the sprint is devoted to development release and retrospective ceremonies.

The first modules of this course will focus first on providing a high-level overview of Agile and comparing it with other popular execution methodologies (Agile is not a one-size-fits-all approach). The later content will provide further information on how to properply execute sprints and Agile execution, including additional Agile concepts and ceremonies.

### Waterfall V.S. Agile V.S. Hybrid

**Execution methodology** refers to the process by which a team will execute a project. Deciding which methodology to use for a project will be a crticial factor in its success, and to that extent, the execution methodology should be clearly understood and consented to by both the execution team and relevant stakeholders. Remember: there is no one best methodlogy to use for every project. Each of the three most popular methodlogies have thier unique benefits and drawbacks.

The key to successfully choosing the best methodology for a specific project is to identify the methodology which appears to provide the most valuable benefits with the least impactful drawbacks. This should include consideration of the execution team's development style, the needs of stakeholders and customers, and basic project requirements (timeline, budget, specifications, etc.). The project manager handling the project is responsible for understanding the methodology options and for recommending the most appropriate methodology in the best interest of the project and its stakeholders. The final decision regarding the exeution methodology will typically fall to an authority above the project manager (ex: program manager, director, executive stakeholder, sometimes the customer).

There are generally 3 approaches to managing and executing a project:

- **Waterfall Methodology** relies on consistent use of strictly defined, documented, and measured project phases. Each project phase is seperated by an approval boundary measuring the project's requirement fitness to proceed. Approval is typically required from one or more relevant stakeholers to verify whether the phase objectives have been completed to the documented specifications. While Waterfall provides strong organizational support through strict process definition, Waterfall is also infamous for its struggle with handling rapidly evolving user needs. Consider a team using Waterfall to complete development on a sleep monitoring app; after development is complete, the app will enter quality assurance testing being deplpoyed to users.

This team unexpectedly receives stakeholder feedback to change some of the app's core design features. However, the design for the app has already be approved, and in a traditional Waterfall implementation, this cannot be changed. Depending on the priority and impact of the requested changes, the team could go back to the Design phase, or aim finish the project and begin planning a new iteration to address the feedback. By the time the team could get to addressing the feedback, there is a high risk it could no longer be relevant to what users are requesting. Additionally, stakeholder & customer disatisfaction is likely due to the time needed to address design feedback, even if the development team has delivered on the agreements made.

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Goals

The **Sprint Goal** is a list of one or more objectives which will be used to determine the scope of appropriate tasks for the given Sprint. The Sprint Goal is determined by the team through review of the **Product Backlog**, and describes the scope negotiation between the project manager and the development team. For these reasons, the defined Sprint Goals should be specific and measurable. The **Sprint Backlog** can then be populated with tasks which the development team committs to executing by the end of the sprint. Note that the tasks in the Sprint Backlog will represent a forecast of the items to be executed by the sprint release.

The list of measures below should be used to assess the quality of a determined Sprint Goal:

- The goal(s) describes how value will be brought to the live product (ex: test a design, address a risk, or deliver a feature).
- The goal(s) ensures a focused Daily Scrum such that the development team can effectively use it to measure progress.
- The goal(s) provides guidance to the development team on why it is building the Sprint.
- The goal(s) offers functionality implementation flexibility (no strict dependencies on other elements, i.e. related but uncompleted work).
- The goal(s) assists with setting priorities when issues emerge.
- The goal(s) fosters cooperation, communication, and teamwork by providing a common goal.
- The goal(s) supports the project manager in creating a **product roadmap** (the high-level plan for the project spanning several sprints).
- The goal(s) stimulates Product Backlog cohesion when planning a release.
- The goal(s) could be shared with relevant stakeholders for expectation and customer management.
- The goal(s) supports focused Sprint Planning.
- The goal(s) measurably supports efficient decision-making

It is critical for the project manager to prevent vague Sprint Goals to keep the team's sprint backlog healthy, appropriate, and accurate to what needs completion. Sprint Goals should be concise, but they do not need to be overly exhaustive. Some examples of solid Sprint Goals include:

- "Get feature X ready for release":
- "Check if the architecture enables the desired performance"
- "Test if users are willing to register before using the product features"

For additional support with formulating an appropriate sprint goal(s), consider the following three questions:

1. Why do we carry out the Sprint? Why is it worthwhile to run a sprint? What should be achieved?
2. How do we reach its goal? Which artefact, validation technique, and test group are used?
3. How do we know the goal has been met? For instance at least three of the five users carry out the usability test successfully in less than a minute

### Task Estimation

```
The best approach to start with relative estimation is to try some examples on real-life objects. Try to compare a phone to a laptop and LCD. Use the following scenario:

1. Put all the stories (objects) in front of developers.
2. Let them choose one story (object) that will get the number Effort=1. Typically it is a small story like â€žI as a user want to save a file to diskâ€œ.
3. Then compare all remaining stories relatively to a referenced story and other, already estimated stories.
4. For example, Story 2 â€“ "I as a user want to calculate average values per year for every customerâ€œ is a more complex story than Story 1 mentioned above. As a developer, I think that this story is 3 times harder than Story 1. Therefore  I will set Effort = 3 story points.

You will do this for every story in your product backlog. This estimation is done by developers and testers. The team sits together in a meeting room with the product owner and talking about stories, what he wants and needs. The product owner will say us as much as he can. We will ask him from a technology point of view. Some stories are changed during the discussion, some new stories can appear as well.

The product is typically estimated in 1-3 full days during the planning meeting.  All your developers and testers known what the product owner wants. The product owner meets with the development team. He sees developers hence closer relations can be built.

The size of stories is estimated in the Fibonacci scale. Scale is 0,0.5, 1,2,3, 5, 8, 13, 20,40,100.

If the story is bigger than the agreed limit (8, 13, or more) then it should be split into smaller stories. It is too complex to be developed.
```

## Daily Scrum

_The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity._

##What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

##What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?


##Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

## Release & Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

What went well in the Sprint?

What could be improved?

What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?
